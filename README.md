#### Matrix and Vector implementation
Template based implementation of Matrix and vector. It supports below arthemtic operations:
1. Addition (Matrix, Vector)
2. Substract (Matrix, Vector)
3. Multiplication (Matrix * Matrix, Matrix * Vector)

Matrix operations:  
* C = A + B
* C += B
* C = A - B
* C -= B
* C = A * B
* C *= B

Vector operations:  
* V = V1 + V2
* V += V2
* V = V1 - V2
* V -= V2

Matrix and Vector multiplication:  
* Vector = Matrix * Vector

#### Test project
The test project has been developed using VS2019 on Windows 10 and to run it please install [Eigen library](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) and configure it as instructed on Eigen documentation.
